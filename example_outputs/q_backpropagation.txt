activation function in the backward pass we multiply the incoming derivative by the partial derivative
of the nodes itself that's simple to compute and actually does exactly what we need it to do
so we will do this in the so-called backward pass right in the forward we went through the network
in the backward we will go the opposite way and whenever we arrive at the node we will
multiply by the partial derivatives and we continue and this way we will arrive at the partial derivatives

Okay, so I'm trying to understand what the chain rule is in backpropagation. Let me see if I can break it down. I remember from my calculus class that the chain rule helps you find the derivative of a composite function, right? It's like when you have functions inside each other.

In this context, they mentioned something about activation functions and derivatives during the backward pass. The question is asking specifically about the chain rule in backpropagation. Hmm, so maybe it's related to how we compute gradients for weights in neural networks?

They said that during the forward pass, each node computes an output based on its inputs and some transformation (like adding a bias and multiplying by weights). Then, during the backward pass, which is after computing the loss, they need to adjust these weights.

The context mentioned something about multiplying the incoming derivative by the partial derivatives of the nodes themselves. So maybe it's about propagating errors backwards through each layer of the network. Each node's error contributes to its parent's weight updates.

I think I recall that in backpropagation, we use the chain rule to compute the gradients efficiently. For example, when calculating the gradient for a weight in a particular laye
r, you need to consider all the ways it affects the lossâ€”both direct connections and indirect through other nodes. So each node's contribution is multiplied by its derivative (which represents how sensitive that node's error is to changes in its weights), and then summed up across all such contributions.

Wait, so this process of multiplying and summing gradients ensures that we update each weight correctly based on how the loss is affected by changes in that weight. That makes sense because without considering all these indirect effects, you might miss out on how a single change affects the overall loss through multiple layers.

I'm trying to make sure I got it right. The chain rule allows us to break down the derivative of a composite function into simpler parts. In neural networks, this is applied layer by layer, so each node's error contributes to its parent's gradients via their derivatives, and all these are summed up for the updates in the network.

I think that's how it works. So the chain rule here helps us compute the necessary gradients efficiently without having to worry about the order of operations or dependencies between nodes.

The chain rule in backpropagation is a method used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network layers. It allows us to propagate errors backwards through the network, considering all indirect effects of changes in individual weights.

**Explanation:**

1. **Forward Pass:** Each node's output is computed based on its inputs and transformations (adding bias and multiplying by weights).
2. **Loss Computation:** The loss is calculated after the forward pass.
3. **Backward Pass:**
   - Weights' gradients are needed to update them during backpropagation.
   - The chain rule decomposes the gradient of the loss with respect to a weight into contributions from all nodes it affects (both direct and indirect).
   - Indirect contributions come from derivatives representing how sensitive each node's error is to changes in its weights.
   - These gradients are multiplied by the derivative of the node's activation function, which captures sensitivity to weights.
   - All these weighted gradients are summed up across all paths through a layer to compute the weight update.

Thus, the chain rule efficiently computes necessary gradients, ensuring accurate updates for each weight based on their indirect effects.
