BERT
A year later after ELMo, at the end of 2018, a new model called BERT (standing for
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was proposed. It is nowadays one of
the most dominating approaches for pre-training word embeddings and for paragraph and
document representations.

of 0.01 is utilized.
Dropout of 0.1 on all layers is used, and GELU activation is used instead of ReLU.
Furthermore, because longer sequences are quadratically more expensive, ﬁrst 90% of the pre-
training is performed on sequences of length 128, and only the last 10% use sequences of length
512.
Two variants are considered:
BERT base with 12 layers, 12 attention heads and hidden size 768 (110M parameters),
BERT large with 24 layers, 16 attention heads and hidden size 1024 (340M parameters).

Okay, I need to describe the BERT architecture as per the context provided. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the architecture is called BERT, proposed at the end of 2018 after ELMo. It's a pre-training model for word embeddings and paragraph representations. So, I should mention that it's a transformer-based model.

The baseline model has 12 Transformer layers. The context also talks about bidirectionality being important but making training difficult because of the complexity. That might come into play later when discussing the architecture's advantages or challenges.

Looking at Figure 3 from "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding," it shows the BERT model computing contextualized representations using a bidirectional Transformer architecture. This confirms that BERT uses both forward and backward passes, which is crucial for capturing context in different directions (like left-to-right and right-to-left).

The figure mentions a weight decay of 0.01 and dropout of 0.1 on all layers with GELU activation instead of ReLU. So, I should note the training setup details here.

Regarding positional embeddings, the context doesn't explicitly mention them. However, since BERT uses transformer-based models which often rely on positional encodings for token representations, it's likely that they are integrated into the model. This would involve encoding positions in the input sequence, which helps the model understand the relative position of words and their surrounding context.

The GELU activation function is mentioned as being used instead of ReLU. I should clarify whether this refers to the activation function applied after attention layers or for other purposes. Since it's a standard practice in transformer models, I'll include that GELU is used in the model.

Additionally, BERT processes sequences with varying lengths. The context mentions first processing 90% of sequences at length 128 and then using longer sequences of length 512 for the remaining. This suggests that there's a hybrid approach where smaller tokens are used early to ensure computational efficiency, while larger tokens provide better positional information in more distant parts of the sentence.

Putting it all together, I should outline the architecture with transformer layers, bidirectional processing, positional embeddings, and the specific activation function. I'll also mention the setup details like weight decay, dropout, and GELU.

The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture is a transformer-based model proposed in 2018 as an extension of ELMo. It is designed for pre-training word embeddings and capturing contextualized representations at both token and sentence levels.

- **Architecture Overview**: The baseline BERT model consists of 12 Transformer layers, which are bidirectionally processed to capture context from both left-to-right and right-to-left directions. This bidirectional architecture allows the model to understand the relationships between words in different contexts (e.g., a word's context on either side).

- **Positional Embeddings**: Positional embeddings are integrated into the transformer framework, enabling the model to assign unique representations to each token based on their position within the sequence. These embeddings help the model understand the relative positions of words and their surrounding context.

- **Training Details**: The architecture uses a training setup that includes:
  - Weight decay of 0.01 for regularization.
  - Dropout with a rate of 0.1 applied to all layers.
  - Activation functions based on GELU (Gated Exponential Linear Units) instead of ReLU, which is commonly used in transformer models.

- **Hybrid Training Setup**: The model processes sequences of varying lengths. Initially, it handles the first 90% of sequences with a token length of 128 to ensure computational efficiency. Subsequently, it uses longer sequences (length 512) for more distant parts of the sentence, enhancing positional information in less frequent contexts.

This architecture effectively combines transformer principles with bidirectional processing and positional encoding to provide robust contextual representations.
