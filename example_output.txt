needs to be passed to the decoder and what they do is they like normally you embed the
generated character in the discrete decoder so then they use another just two layers
to transform it mutably and pass it again on the on the input state of the decoder right so
part things being slightly more continuous than then usual this is just the usual architecture
so there are some details about the spectra which are there just for fun they also use slightly

Transformers
Main Takeaway
Generally, Transformer provides more powerful sequence-to-sequence architecture and also
sequence element representation architecture than RNNs, but requires substantially more data.

Answer:
 <think>
Alright, so I need to figure out where someone can find a visualization of a decoder-only model using Transformers. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

First, the context mentions that after embedding generated characters into the discrete decoder, models like Transformers are used for sequence-to-sequence tasks and also handle representing sequences element-wise. The key point here is that they're talking about decoder-only models, which probably refers to models that don't embed text but instead directly process it through the Transformer layers.

Looking at the context again, there's a part that says "part things being slightly more continuous than then usual this is just the usual architecture." That might mean that some details were added for fun or as an exploration. Then, in the main takeaway, they mention Transformers and how they provide powerful architectures but require more data.

Then there's a 3D visualization on BBycroft.net about GPT models' computation steps, specifically focusing on decoder-only models. The user provided a link to that page which likely has images or videos explaining the Transformer computations for such models.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is that you can find a visualization of a decoder-only model using Transformers by visiting BBycroft.net and checking out their 3D visualization section on GPT models. The specific part they refer to is the "Decoder-Only Model" section.

To find a visualization of a decoder-only model using Transformers, visit BBycroft.net. Navigate to the 3D Visualization section on their GPT models page, where there's an in-depth explanation of the Transformer computation steps for decoder-only models.
